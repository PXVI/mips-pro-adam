# mips-pro-adam
<br />
This is a MIPS microprocessor hardware design. The design is in no way meant to be a full fledged RTL with some extreme application. This is rather to build my understanding of the processor design and eventually the verification. <br />
I will be using the MIPS ISA, to which extent, I do not know. Primary goal is to actually build a microarchitecture which will serve as a learning reference for myself or anyone who is intereted. The microarchitectures ( one after the other ) which I will be implementing are :<br />
<br />
<b>1. Single Cycle Processor Design</b><br />
<b>2. Multi Cycle Processor Design</b><br />
<b>3. Pipelined Processor Design</b><br />
